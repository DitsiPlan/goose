They <a href='http://ww2.husuma.com/Measure-and-Improve-1518232921.html'>probably</a> have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren't bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail. Following <a href='http://mangotree.sdbx.jp/index18.html'>these</a> guidelines for <a href='http://ww342.droppages.com/index36.html'>proper</a> keyword placement shows Google that your keywords are important to your web page and your website. <h2>Give a thought to indexed pages when outlining your web strategy</h2>Infographics <a href='http://liason.clicforum.com/t4-Google-might-discount-irrelevant-links.htm#p4'>are</a> candies for <a href='http://barbara.hariko.com/starting_out/index14.html'>our</a> brains. They're engaging, catch our attention and make information consuming faster. In fact, infographics are liked and shared 3x more on social media than any other type of content. Google <a href='http://frugalnuts.fourfour.com/news/post/organic-seo-the-path-to-a-successful-online-business'>will</a> ignore and <a href='http://xbds.sdbx.jp/index14.html'>not</a> index pages with content of 200 words or less.

More website links bring more traffic, and that helps boost your web traffic. More importantly, Google counts every link to your website as a vote of sorts. If you get a lot of good "votes" from other relevant and reputable websites, Google will reward you with higher rankings in the search engine results and you'll get even more visibility and traffic. Google generates far more traffic than any of the other search engines, including Bing(Microsoft), Yahoo and all the other search engines combined, so being high on the Google search engine results is what it's all about!
