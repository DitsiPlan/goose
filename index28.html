Over <a href='http://realise.mypressonline.com/The-back-story-of-URLs-1525130941.html'>the</a> years many <a href='http://indozine.com'>people</a> have tried to game the system by creating content that is stuffed full of keywords in the hope that repeating their keyword phrases over and over again will in some way get them to the top spot of Google. While this tactic may have worked in the 90's and early 2000's it is time to put this to bed and stop creating content that is written solely for the search engines. These search engines have evolved and now recognise and reward natural language so the best piece of advice is to write naturally and for humans.
